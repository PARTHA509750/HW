    <p>Fiverr Community,</p>
    <p>Fiverr celebrated ten years at the beginning of this year. When we started the company back in 2010, it was the year marking a decade in which freelancing became mainstream, widely chosen by many worldwide as a way of life and used by many businesses to get things done.</p>
    <p>We believe that 2020 marks the beginning of a decade in which freelancing will take another step forward, a decade in which businesses will learn how to effectively integrate freelancers into their workflows and benefit from having access to the best talent in the world with just a few clicks.</p>
    <p>This is a massive win for our way of life and for the culture we are building together. Ten years ago, we had a dream - a dream of building the world's largest community, connecting talented people from around the world with businesses that need that talent. Today, we are the largest and fastest-growing community we dreamed of, but our book is far from being entirely written. In fact, we wake up every morning infused with a desire to help this incredible community grow and make our platform even better so that anyone who uses it will be able to make more from it and pursue their dreams.</p>
    <p>Our brand symbolizes home for so many of you, and today we are introducing a new chapter in our brand. We have refreshed our logo and we are launching a new brand campaign updated with a more modern approach, but one that is true to our origins. You have been in the center of every intersection of our doing, from the product we created for you to the moment of ringing the bell on Wall Street a year ago. Our community has always been there, and in this new brand campaign, it is you that is there, again, proving the strength and diversity of our global talent. We are honored to share this new campaign with you and are positive that you will love it as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>
    <p>Here's to writing another chapter together and changing how the world works.</p><br>
    <p>Micha</p>
    <p>Founder & Chief Executive Officer</p>
